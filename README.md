# 👋 Hi, I’m Prakhar Verma.

I'm a tech enthusiast with a passion for coding, logic building, and computer science. Besides programming, I find joy in exploring books of different genres, sketching, and delving into geopolitics to broaden my horizons.

🌱 Recently, I have completed MCA degree from the University of Allahabad, where I have learnt many new skills.

💞️ I’m excited to collaborate on open-source projects and contribute to the vibrant developer community.

📫 Feel free to reach out to me at prakharverma3997@gmail.com. I'm always open to new opportunities and connections.

Let's create and innovate together! 🚀
